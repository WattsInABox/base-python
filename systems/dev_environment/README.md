# Dev Environment container

This container contains python, and all clients and software needed for development. This container represents what one would normally install on a computer in order to develop within this project.

It is everyone's responsibility to make sure the whole dev environment (not just this container) contains the proper versions of each client or service that will guarantee successful runs in latest and beyond.

## Dependencies

Depends on the `python:3.7.6-alpine3.11` container from docker hub.
